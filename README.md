# POC of app for searching github issues by label and language

I created this project in Next.js + Typescript + Apollo + code generation just because i will use these technologies on the next project. So i think it is overkill to use these techs for this app but it is what is

Planning to finish my work asap, but you can try it in development mode using `npm run dev`

## Docker (temporary reminder)

* `docker build -t tabomors/issues-finder .`
* `docker run -p 3333:3000 tabomors/issues-finder`
